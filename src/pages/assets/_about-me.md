Hey there, I'm Fabian Afonso — but online, I go by **Savutro**.

Ever since I was a kid, technology had me hooked. I still remember watching my dad do what looked like *digital wizardry* on an old computer — and I was absolutely mesmerized. That spark never left.

Fast forward a bit, I started diving into beginner coding and robotics courses during school. That’s where I first met my old friends: the **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi**. From blinking LEDs to janky robot arms, it was love at first script.

After finishing up at the *Gymnasium*, I took a detour into German language studies — which, spoiler alert: wasn’t really my thing. Lesson learned.

So I hit reset, slowed things down, and jumped into a more hands-on path: a fast-tracked apprenticeship at **Swisscom (Schweiz) AG**. That’s where theory met practice and things finally started clicking.

These days, I’ve leveled up to a new adventure at **Bernmobil**, where I’m helping shape the future of public transport through the development and operation of several internal apps and systems. 🚍💻
