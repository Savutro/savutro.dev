Hi there, I'm Fabian Afonso. For my online persona I go by the name Savutro. 

Since I was little I got really invested in technology. I remembered how my dad did some "magical" stuff on his old computer and it was simply fascinating.

From then on I took part in several beginner courses during my school time to learn the basics of coding and robotics. It was then when I had my first touchpoints with **Arduinos** and **RaspberryPis**. 

After graduating from the "Gymnasium" I decided to go for german language studies which in the end wasn't really mine. After this setback I started out doing things slowly, so I decided to invest my time in a shortened apprenticeship at **Swisscom (Schweiz) AG**. 

Now that I completed that journey, I started a new one at **Bernmobil** where I'll take on the **development** and **operation** of several apps and components related to public transport.
