Since I was little I got really invested in technology. I remembered how my dad worked on a Comodore 64 at home. When I received my first GameBoy from cousin, it all started out. I wanted to understand the inner workings. 

From then on I took part in several beginner courses during my school time to learn the basics of coding and robotics. It was then when I had my first touchpoints with **Arduinos** and **RaspberryPis**. 

After graduating from the "Gymnasium" I had to take a step back and start out doing things slowly, so I decided to invest my time in a shortened apprenticeship at **Swisscom (Schweiz) AG**

Now that I completed that journey, I started a new one at **Bernmobil** where I'll take on the **development** and **operation** of several apps and components related to public transport.
