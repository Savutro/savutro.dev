# `$ sudo savutro start --introduction`

Welcome, digital wanderer. You've stumbled upon **savutro.dev**, my all-in-one geek sanctuary, productivity playground, and personal brag board.  
This isn't just a website — it's a full-stack brain dump with *style*.

Let me give you the grand tour. 🚀

### 🛠️ Dev-Environment

Wanna see how I summon code from the void? This section dives into my environment setup, scripts that make life easier, and some magic incantations (aka terminal commands) that I use daily. Expect dotfiles, shell tweaks, and questionable aliases.

### 🧪 Projects

Here's where the real chaos lives. Every project I've touched — whether it thrived or gloriously exploded — is documented here. If it's in the Showcase, it’s probably working. Or at least looks cool while failing.

### 📚 Tutorials

Things I’ve learned, or at least pretended to understand long enough to write about. This is the attic of my technical brain: dusty but full of treasure. Proceed with curiosity and coffee.

### ✨ Showcase

The cool stuff. The demos. The shiny buttons. Think of this as the museum wing of the site. You can browse through projects like you’re window-shopping for open source ideas.

### 📄 CV

Yes, it's a CV. In markdown. Because PDFs are for corporates and I have a keyboard. If you want to know what I've done professionally — or need to convince HR I'm not a robot — this is the place.

### 📝 Blog

My thoughts, rants, insights, and caffeine-fueled rabbit holes. Topics may include tech, life, existential dread, and the occasional good idea.

Make yourself at home, click around, and if you find a typo... no you didn’t. 😉
